# Polkadot Asset Hub Hackathon Project Ideas

Based on the research and the judges' preference for gaming and DeFi applications, here are potential project ideas that can be completed within a 2-hour timeframe:

## DeFi Project Ideas

1. **Token Staking Rewards System**
   - Simple staking mechanism where users can stake tokens and earn rewards
   - Leverages Asset Hub's native token capabilities
   - Can be completed quickly with a straightforward smart contract

2. **Simple DEX (Decentralized Exchange)**
   - Basic token swap functionality
   - Limited to 2-3 token pairs for simplicity
   - Uses Asset Hub for token management

3. **Yield Farming Mini-App**
   - Users deposit tokens to earn rewards
   - Time-based reward distribution
   - Simple UI for deposit/withdraw operations

## Gaming Project Ideas

1. **Blockchain Lottery**
   - Users buy tickets with tokens
   - Smart contract randomly selects winners
   - Transparent and verifiable on-chain

2. **NFT-based Collectible Game**
   - Simple collectible card system
   - Basic trading functionality
   - Leverages Asset Hub's token standards

3. **On-chain Prediction Market**
   - Users bet on simple outcomes (e.g., coin flip)
   - Smart contract handles result verification
   - Automatic reward distribution

## Hybrid Gaming/DeFi Ideas

1. **Play-to-Earn Mini-Game**
   - Simple game mechanics (e.g., daily check-in, simple tasks)
   - Token rewards for participation
   - Staking mechanism for boosting rewards

2. **NFT Staking Game**
   - Users stake NFTs to earn rewards
   - Different NFT traits affect reward rates
   - Simple UI for staking/unstaking

## Evaluation Criteria

For a 2-hour hackathon project, we should prioritize:
- Feasibility within time constraints
- Demonstrating Polkadot Asset Hub's unique features
- Clean, well-documented code
- Working end-to-end implementation
- Potential for future expansion

## Recommended Project: Play-to-Earn Token Staking Game

**Concept**: A simple game where users can stake tokens to participate in a daily lottery/reward system. The more tokens staked, the higher chance of winning.

**Why this works well for a 2-hour hackathon**:
- Combines both gaming and DeFi elements (appealing to judges)
- Demonstrates Asset Hub's token capabilities
- Can be implemented with a relatively simple smart contract
- Has a clear UI/UX flow that can be built quickly
- Showcases Polkadot's performance benefits for gaming applications

This project would allow us to create a complete end-to-end application with both smart contract and frontend components within the time constraints.
