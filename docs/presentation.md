# Play-to-Earn Token Staking Game
## Polkadot Asset Hub Hackathon Presentation

---

## Project Overview

A DeFi gaming application that combines staking mechanics with lottery-style rewards

- **Concept**: Stake tokens to participate in a reward system
- **Mechanics**: Higher stakes = higher chance of winning
- **Innovation**: Blends gaming excitement with DeFi incentives

---

## Key Features

- **Token Staking**: Users lock tokens to participate
- **Probability-Based Rewards**: Winning chance proportional to stake
- **Owner Controls**: Reward distribution management
- **Real-time Statistics**: Stake amounts and winning probabilities
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile

---

## Technical Implementation

- **Smart Contracts**: Custom Solidity contracts deployed on Moonbeam
- **Frontend**: React application with ethers.js integration
- **Wallet Connection**: MetaMask integration for Moonbase Alpha
- **Demo Mode**: Fallback option for users without wallets

---

## How We Used Polkadot

- **Moonbeam Parachain**: Deployed on Polkadot's EVM-compatible parachain
- **Cross-Chain Potential**: Foundation for multi-parachain interactions
- **Scalability Benefits**: Leverages Polkadot's efficient consensus
- **Ecosystem Integration**: Part of the broader Polkadot network
