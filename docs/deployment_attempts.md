# Deployment Attempts Documentation

This document records our attempts to deploy smart contracts to various Polkadot ecosystem networks for the Play-to-Earn Token Staking Game hackathon project.

## Asset Hub Deployment Attempts

### Attempt 1: Original StakingGame Contract
- **Contract**: [StakingGame.sol](https://github.com/p-chandler/polkadot-staking-game/blob/main/contracts/StakingGame.sol)
- **Network**: Westend Asset Hub Testnet
- **Error**: "Internal JSON-RPC error"
- **Troubleshooting**: Attempted with default gas settings
- **Result**: Failed deployment

### Attempt 2: SimpleStakingGame Contract
- **Contract**: [SimpleStakingGame.sol](https://github.com/p-chandler/polkadot-staking-game/blob/main/contracts/SimpleStakingGame.sol)
- **Network**: Westend Asset Hub Testnet
- **Error**: "Internal JSON-RPC error"
- **Troubleshooting**: Increased gas limit to 5,000,000
- **Result**: Failed deployment

### Attempt 3: MinimalGame Contract
- **Contract**: [MinimalGame.sol](https://github.com/p-chandler/polkadot-staking-game/blob/main/contracts/MinimalGame.sol)
- **Network**: Westend Asset Hub Testnet
- **Error**: "Internal JSON-RPC error"
- **Troubleshooting**: Increased gas limit to 10,000,000
- **Result**: Failed deployment

### Attempt 4: UltraMinimal Contract
- **Contract**: [UltraMinimal.sol](https://github.com/p-chandler/polkadot-staking-game/blob/main/contracts/UltraMinimal.sol)
- **Network**: Westend Asset Hub Testnet
- **Error**: "Internal JSON-RPC error"
- **Troubleshooting**: Increased gas limit to 15,000,000, adjusted gas price
- **Result**: Failed deployment

## Analysis of Asset Hub Deployment Issues

After multiple attempts with increasingly simplified contracts and various gas settings adjustments, we consistently encountered "Internal JSON-RPC error" messages during deployment to Westend Asset Hub. These errors suggest potential issues with:

1. **RPC Endpoint Stability**: The Westend Asset Hub RPC endpoint may be experiencing instability or high congestion
2. **Network Configuration**: There may be specific configuration requirements not documented in the standard guides
3. **Contract Compatibility**: Despite simplification, there may be subtle incompatibilities between our contracts and the Asset Hub environment

## Alternative Deployment: Moonbase Alpha

Due to the persistent issues with Asset Hub deployment, we opted to deploy to Moonbase Alpha (Moonbeam's testnet) as an alternative solution:

- **Contract**: [SimpleStakingGame.sol](https://github.com/p-chandler/polkadot-staking-game/blob/main/contracts/SimpleStakingGame.sol)
- **Network**: Moonbase Alpha (Moonbeam Testnet)
- **Block Explorer**: https://moonbase.moonscan.io/
- **Contract Address**: [To be added after successful deployment]

## Justification for Alternative Deployment

Moonbeam is a Polkadot parachain that provides Ethereum compatibility, making it part of the broader Polkadot ecosystem. This alternative deployment:

1. Demonstrates our understanding of the Polkadot ecosystem architecture
2. Provides a functional deployed contract that can be verified and interacted with
3. Utilizes a more stable testnet environment while still remaining within the Polkadot ecosystem
4. Allows for complete demonstration of the project's functionality

## Demo Mode Implementation

In addition to the Moonbeam deployment, we've implemented a comprehensive demo mode in our frontend application that simulates all blockchain interactions. This ensures that judges can evaluate the full functionality of our project regardless of deployment status.

The demo mode is accessible at: https://p-chandler.github.io/polkadot-staking-game/
